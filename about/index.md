<center>A developer girl, always learning something.</center>

## Let's start from beginning

I discovered my profession in my first college. I started to study **Science and Technology** in a public university in Brazil in 2013. I had a lot of subjects and one of them was Information Processing, where I had my first contact with **codes and Java**. That time, I decided to change the course to another one, that was more focused in **development**. 

I did my internship in a Brazilian company, where I learned and developed myself a lot and I had the opportunity to work with the *Brazilian Army*, developing new features in their system.

After that, I started to work in the *financial environment*, where I've been working for about 2 years.

During my time of experience I learned how to develop with **responsibility**, I had to, considering my positions and responsibilities.

## My purpose here

I really like to write and I'm always learning and trying something new, so why not combine these two things? Well, here I am and I hope that this place and my posts **helps** you in some way (:



## What to do now?

Take some coffee and start to read my first article about Docker. Enjoy!!
